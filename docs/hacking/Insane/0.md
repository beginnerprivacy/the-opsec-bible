## **Part 1 : Initial Enumeration**

As always we begin our Enumeration using **Nmap** to enumerate opened ports. We will be using the flags **-sC** for default scripts and **-sV** to enumerate versions.
    
    
    λ nihilist [ 127.0.0.1 ] [~]
    → nmap -F 127.0.0.1
    Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-02-19 22:08 GMT
    Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
    Host is up (0.00024s latency).
    Not shown: 99 closed ports
    PORT     STATE SERVICE
    3306/tcp open  mysql
    
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
